Usage of this is simple, create a crontab entry like this :
# Change the password automatically so I don't get pestered anymore for changes
59 08 01 * * ~/bin/passwdchange.sh scomp0001.wurnet.nl short001 Curr3ntP4ssw0rD

Now at every first day of the month, at 8h59, the script will cycle through 
89 random passwords, and then set it back to the original one.

For me this has worked for a while now.
